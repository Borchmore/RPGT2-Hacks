Hello again! :^)

I'm setting up this repository to keep track of my RPG Tsukuru 2 hacks and translations, as well as the RPGT2 SRAM file containing my game (note: I wrote over the sample game on rpg maker hack 3 with a build from 12/3/2017, so you can play it as a standalone ROM instead of loading the SRAM file). Included are the source translation (thank you Magecraft!), the current build, and three hacked files I rounded up from my old computer. This project has been on hiatus for about a year now, though I will probably visit it again soon now that I have deeper knowledge of ASM hacking.

As always, thanks for checking out my projects!
